        <h1>Bitcoin Education</h1>
        <p>
            Bitcoiners are relentless educators who want to help people learn.  That said, there is a 
            lot of noise out there, and this page aims to find some signal. 
Use this as a launch point, but follow your curiosity as you do your own research and come up with 
your own conclusions. This information is ultimately a place for me to organize my research 
in case I want to circle back to it. But maybe it can  be helpful to someone's learning.

<h3>Best way to learn? Use it</h3>

<p>There are no shortage of educational resources that have already been created by others if you are willing to look.
Below are my favorites. There are many ways to get creative with hardware and software combinations.  If I were to start over, 
I would optimize for privacy and simplicity. Staying organized is important. Set small milestones for yourself and start chipping away.  
It takes effort but grokking Bitcoin is worth it. The learning never stops.</p>
