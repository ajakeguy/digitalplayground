        <h1>Bitcoin Education</h1>
        <p>
            Bitcoiners are relentless educators who want to help people learn.  That said, there is a 
            lot of noise out there, and this page aims to find some signal. 
            Use this as a launch point, but follow your curiosity as you do your own research and come up with 
            your own conclusions. This information is ultimately a place for me to organize my research 
            in case I want to circle back to it. But maybe it can  be helpful to someone's learning.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
            <p>Thats the 21,000,000 bitcoin question. Everyone is trying to figure it out. The best way to start is by learning about the fundamentals.
                The learning never stops, but it's important to understand some of the fundamentals below.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>

       
        <h3>Bitcoin Monetary Fundamentals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Divisble: 100,000,000 sats in 1 bitcoin that can be divided further if needed</li>
            <li>Portable: Information that can be sent through a communications channel or stored in your head</li>
            <li>Fungible: UTXO sets allows bitcoin (or sats) to be sent in any amount. Multiple bills can be used to make up $20. Same concept.</li>
            <li>Durable: Incorruptible ledger secured by miners and verified by nodes</li>
            <li>Scarce (Terminal inflation = 0%): Algorithmically enforced supply of 21,000,000 units that can't be changed. Mathematical discovery</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h3>Bitcoin Technical Fundamentals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Decentralized: no single point of failure</li>
            <li>Terminal inflation = 0:Fixed supply of 21,000,000 bitcoin</li>
            <li>Predictable supply schedule: block reward halves every 210,000 blocks</li>
            <li>Permissionless: anyone can use the protocol</li>
            <li>Peer-to-peer: no trusted third parties</li>
            <li>Proof of work: Block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network</li>
            <li>Difficulty adjustment: major innovation of Bitcoin that maintains the fixed supply schedule</li>
            <li>Fungible UTXO sets</li>
            <li>Censorless: nobody can stop a Bitcoin transaction</li>
            <li>Verifiable: run your own version of the software to verify the ledger for yourself (Don't trust, Verify)</li>
            <li>Public-private key cryptography</li>
            <li>Trustless: no third party required to transfer information from 'A' to 'B'</li>
            <li>Reliable: 24/7/365</li>
            <li>Open source: anyone can see the code, contribute to the project, build tools and add layers on top of Bitcoin. Adaptable.</li>
            <li>Secure: secured by miners - the most secure computing network in the world</li>
            <li>Universal: anyone with an internet connection can use Bitcoin</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h3>Bitcoin Practical Fundamentals</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Freedom to receive</li>
            <li>Freedom to hold</li>
            <li>Freedom to send</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h3>Bitcoin Monetization Path</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Store of value</li>
            <li>Medium of exchange</li>
            <li>Unit of account (hyperbitcoinization)</li>
        </ol>
        <br>

<h3>Best way to learn? Use it</h3>

<p>There are no shortage of educational resources that have already been created by others if you are willing to look.
Below are my favorites. There are many ways to get creative with hardware and software combinations.  If I were to start over, 
I would optimize for privacy and simplicity. Staying organized is important. Set small milestones for yourself and start chipping away.  
It takes effort but grokking Bitcoin is worth it. The learning never stops.</p>
