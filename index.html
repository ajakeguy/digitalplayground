        <h1>Digital Playground</h1>
        <p> Hey Friends!  This goal of this site is to consolidate educational content, tools, and information from random corners of the internet
            to help individuals learning about Bitcoin and open source software. make decisions and build their own digital
            playground. As we transition away from centralized technology services to a Bitcoin Standard and FOSS-powered Information Age, it's important to know
            the tools that are out there. Hopefully this site can 
            serve as a launching pad to help shorten the learning curve for those willing to put in the work. Decentralized digital playgrounds
            sound better to me than centralized digital cages. LFG
        </p>

<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
<p>Everyone has the choice to learn.
    There are endless amounts of content, guides, and tools that have been created to help those willing to put in the work.
    This ~digital playground~ consolidates information that's been helpful to me along this (never-ending) journey.
    The goal is to continue to shorten the learning curve for those just starting.
    That said, don’t trust this site and DYOR to understand the trade-offs. This research is just a tool for education, not financial or technical advice.</p>
