        <h1>Digital Playground - in progress</h1>
        <p> Hey Friends!  This goal of this site is to consolidate educational content, tools, and information from random corners of the internet
            to help individuals learn about Bitcoin and the privacy-focused tools that are out there. As we transition away from centralized technology services to a Bitcoin Standard and FOSS-powered Information Age, it's important to know
            the tools that are out there for individuals to regain control over their digital lives. Control over your digital life = freedom in the digital age. 
            Hopefully this site can serve as a launching pad to help shorten the learning curve for those willing to put in the work. Decentralized digital playgrounds
            sound better to me than centralized digital cages. 
        </p>

<h2>Housekeeping</h2>
<p>Everyone has the choice to learn.
    There are endless amounts of content, guides, and tools that have been created to help those willing to put in the work.
    This ~digital playground~ consolidates information that's been helpful to me along this (never-ending) journey.
    The goal is to continue to shorten the learning curve for those just starting.
    That said, don’t trust this site and DYOR to understand the trade-offs. This research is just a tool for education, not financial or technical advice.</p>

    <h2 style="color:orange;">What's the big idea?</h2>
    <p>The whole world is still trying to figure out what this thing is and the potential impacts it might have on<br> the world (see digital bookshelf).  
        This is a discovery on par with fire, agriculture, electricity, and the internet <br> that requires an open mind, humility, and desire to learn. It’s everyone’s choice to educate themselves on Bitcoin,<br> 
        understand the problems it’s solving, and use it.  Enjoy the ride :)</p>
